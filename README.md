### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I am Lucrezia and I am a PhD candidate in developmental biology @ [the Norden Lab][websitelab]. The mysteries of Biology fascinate me, but I do also have a lot of fun with programming and image analysis! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently investigating some physical properties of the retinal neuroepithelium during development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to perform quantitative image analysis of huge datasets and apply deep learning tools to process my data
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about everything! I am always up for interesting chats
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: drop me an email!

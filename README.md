### Hi there 👋



I am Lucrezia and I am a PhD candidate @ [the Norden Lab][websitelab]. The mysteries of Nature has always fascinated me and for this reason I decided to get a degree in Biotechnology (B.Sc & M.Sc.). During this journey in the world of Biology, I learnt Python programming and came to realize how much fun it is to perform image and data analysis on the data I generate in the lab! 

- 🔭  I’m currently investigating the role of tissue packing in developing neuroepithelia 
- 🌱  I’m learning how to perform quantitative image analysis and apply deep learning tools to process my datasets
- 💬  I love to discuss (anything, really), so ask me what you want! 
- 📫  How to reach me: drop me an email!

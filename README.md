### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I am Lucrezia and I am a PhD candidate in developmental biology @ [the Norden Lab][websitelab]. The mysteries of Biology fascinate me, but I do also have a lot of fun with programming and image analysis! 

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently investigating the role of pseudostratification in developing neuroepithelia 
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m learning how to perform quantitative image analysis and apply deep learning tools to process the data I generate at the microscope
- ðŸ’¬  Ask me about everything! I am always up for interesting chats
- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: drop me an email!

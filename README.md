### Hi there 👋

<!--
**lcferme/lcferme** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am Lucrezia and I am a PhD candidate in developmental biology @ [the Norden Lab][websitelab]. The lurking mysteries of Biology fascinate me, but I do also love programming and image analysis. Python is my language (or weapon?) of choice.

- 🔭 I’m currently investigating some physical properties of the retinal neuroepithelium during development, in particular using zebrafish 🦓🐟 and human organoids 🤷🏽‍♀️ as model systems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to perform quantitative image analysis of huge datasets and apply deep learning tools to process my data
- 💬 Ask me about everything! I am always up for interesting chats
- 📫 How to reach me: drop me an email

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I am Lucrezia and I am a PhD candidate @ [the Norden Lab][websitelab]. The mysteries of Nature have always fascinated me and for this reason I decided to pursue a degree in Biotechnology (B.Sc & M.Sc.). During this journey, I learnt Python programming and came to realize how much fun it is to perform image and data analysis on the data I generate in the lab :)

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently investigating the role of tissue packing in developing neuroepithelia 
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m learning how to perform quantitative image analysis and apply deep learning tools to process my datasets
- ðŸ’¬  I love to discuss (anything, really), so ask me what you want! 
- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: drop me an email!

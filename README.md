### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I am Lucrezia and I am a PhD candidate @ [the Norden Lab][websitelab]. The mysteries of Nature have always fascinated me and for this reason I decided to pursue a degree in Biotechnology (B.Sc & M.Sc.). ðŸ”­
During this journey, I was so lucky to stumble into Python and came to realize how much fun I have when doing image and data analysis on the data I generate in the lab... (almost) all home-made! ðŸŒ± 
Currently, Iâ€™m investigating the role of tissue packing in developing neuroepithelia with the help of some amazing collaborators (physicists and bio-image analysis experts), so I hope to have soon more interesting things to show up here! Meanwhile, if you want to reach me for a chat, just drop me a line! ðŸ’¬
